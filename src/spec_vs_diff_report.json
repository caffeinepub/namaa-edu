  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Create a new Motoko source file under `backend/` containing a minimal, side-effect-free `module { ... }` (not an actor), without modifying `backend/main.mo`, and without changing canister behavior/state/interface.",
      "reason": "No files were added under `backend/` (Added: 0). The only change is to `project_state.json`, and there is no evidence of a new Motoko module file or any backend directory changes. While `backend/main.mo` was not modified, the core requirement (adding a new backend Motoko module file) is not implemented.",

      "reason": "The BuildRequest is narrowly scoped to adding a no-op backend Motoko module file; the diff modifies `project_state.json` with summaries and requests about chunked uploads and interaction policy not requested as part of REQ-1 implementation.",
